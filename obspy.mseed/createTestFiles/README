Creates Mini-SEED files using libmseed directly. Sorry for the bad C code. Some comments might also not fit to the code.

On UNIX just run ./buildandrun.sh

A copy or a symlink to a shared libmseed library must be in the parent directory. The easiest way would be to place this folder in the libmseed directory.

The filename is always the type of the datasample (int, float, ...) and the output encoding. The files will be created in the output directory.

Every file will be 256 bytes long.

Every encoding that supports numbers will contain 50 numbers from 1 to 50.

Furthermore there are two ASCII files. The full ASCII files contains all 95 printable ASCII strings and the small ASCII file contains the first 8 letters of the alphabet.
