    It is probably pretty safe to set the first_record parameter to True
    because the timing quality is a vendor specific value and thus it will
    probably be set for each record or for none.

    The method to calculate the quantiles uses a integer round outwards
    policy: lower quantiles are rounded down (probability < 0.5), and upper
    quantiles (probability > 0.5) are rounded up.
    This gives no more than the requested probability in the tails, and at
