## Old svn /branches of ObsPy

This repository is not intended to be further worked on. Instead it is only intended to keep the old svn branches directory available after shutdown of the svn server. Parts of the repository including the respective history of changes can be transferred into other git repositories following the instructions in the [ObsPy wiki](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki/Svn-to-git-migration) (cloning this repository and modifying the history to exclude the unwanted parts). If you need help doing so [open an issue](https://github.com/obspy/branches/issues/new).
